Feature: Users can navigate back to the parent page from a resource.
  As a user
  I would like to return to the previous page that I opened the article on.
  So I can view other content.

  Background:

    And I set the site theme to "ventura"
    And I enable the "engage_resources" advanced feature
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email             |
      | user1    | User      | One      | user1@example.com |
      | user2    | User      | Two      | user2@example.com |
    And the following "topics" exist in "totara_topic" plugin:
      | name   |
      | Topic1 |
    And the following "articles" exist in "engage_article" plugin:
      | name      | username | content | access | topics |
      | Article 1 | user1    | A1      | PUBLIC | Topic1 |
      | Article 2 | user2    | A2      | PUBLIC | Topic1 |
