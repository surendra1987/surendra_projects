### Required database configuration

*PostgreSQL*
- To create your database:  
  `createdb -E utf8 {dbname}`
- For security, we recommend you use a dedicated database user who has access just to the Totara database.
- enable_memoize: For PostgreSQL 14.0 and 14.1, this setting must be off.

*MariaDB*
- Barracuda file format 
- To create your database:  
  `CREATE DATABASE {dbname} DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;`  
  _Note: the above collation is a general collation, we recommend choosing an appropriate collation for your primary language_
- For security, we recommend you use a dedicated database user who has access just to the Totara database.
- innodb_read_only_compressed: For MariaDB 10.6 onwards, this setting must be off.

*MySQL*
- Barracuda file format
- To create your database:  
  `CREATE DATABASE {dbname} DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_as_cs;`  
  _Note: the above collation is a general collation, we recommend choosing an appropriate collation for your primary language_
- For security, we recommend you use a dedicated database user who has access just to the Totara database.

*MSSQL*
- Your database user must have permission to alter server settings  
  `ALTER SETTINGS(SERVER)`
- Full text search must be enabled; see [Full text search in MSSQL Server](https://help.totaralearning.com/display/latest/Full+Text+Search+in+MS+SQL+Server)
- For security, we recommend you use a dedicated database user who has access just to the Totara database.

### Required server configuration

If you are planning to use Totara in multiple user languages, you should ensure that the server is properly configured with the correct locales.
This is important to ensure that date, number and currency data is displayed correctly for each language.

### Required PHP configuration

The following settings should be adjusted in your php.ini file:

- **memory_limit**  
  This will need to be increased for restoring large course backups or unzipping large files within Totara
- **post_max_size**  
  Ensure that this is larger than the largest file that you expect your users to upload.
- **upload_max_filesize**  
  This setting in conjunction with "post_max_size" will determine how high you can set the max upload size within Totara
- **max_input_vars=10000**  
  Increasing this setting is recommended as operations such as modifying languages, or large gradebooks may hit the default limit of 1000. Setting to 10000 does not introduce any performance overheads.
- **upload_tmp_dir**  
  Some customers may wish to enable this setting and specifically set a directory where files are temporarily stored during the upload process. Note the web server user must have permissions to write files in this directory, or all file uploads will fail.
- **opcache.enable=1**  
  If the opcache extension is installed then enabling opcache is recommended for performance reasons. This is enabled by default in modern versions of PHP.
- **opcache.memory_consumption=256**  
  Totara is a large application, 256 should be sufficient depending upon the number of plugins installed.
- **opcache.interned_strings_buffer=16**  
  Opcache interns strings to save on memory usage. Totara still makes use of many hard coded strings for programmatic reasons.
- **opcache.max_accelerated_files=16229**  
  Totara has a large number of files, 16229 is the most suitable prime number, any value between 7963 and 16229 will be rounded up to 16229.
- **opcache.validate_timestamps=1**  
  It is safest to keep this enabled.
- **opcache.revalidate_freq=2**  
  Defaults to 2, on production sites this can be increased safely however you should then consider ensuring that PHP opcache is invalidated if an action leading to file changes occurs.
- **opcache.enable_cli=1**  
  Marginal benefit, but is safe to enable.
- **opcache.file_cache_fallback=1**  
  Should be enabled on Windows, and *opcache.file_cache* should be set to an already existing and writable directory
- **opcache.save_comments**  
  For production sites it is safe to disable this setting. For development, it is required.
- **opcache.enable_file_override**  
  Can be used provided validate_timestamps has been enabled. Some parts of Totara check file existence when enabling pluggability and extensibility.

For more information on changing these settings see [PHP documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php).
After changing any settings in php.ini you will need to restart your web server, and/or PHP-FPM if you are using that.

<a name="installation" />

## Installation

The following is a quick installation overview. 

1. Create a database for Totara to use.  
   Totara supports PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MySQL, and MSSQL. If you are unsure which to choose we recommend PostgreSQL as it
   delivers good performance out of the box without requiring tuning.  
   Totara needs to be provided with a username and password to use when connecting to the database. We recommend settings 
   up a dedicated user for Totara to use.
   
2. Create a directory in which Totara will store files.  
   User files, cache files, and temporary files will be stored in this directory. If you are horizontally scaling your
   web architecture then it is important to note that this directory MUST be shared between all nodes.
   The data directory must be writable by the web server user.
   The data directory must not be web accessible.
   
3. Configure your web server.  
   In order to access Totara you require a web server, and a domain on which Totara will be accessed. The web server needs
   to be configured so that the document root for your domain points to the "server" directory within the code base.
   The server directory contains web accessible code. The top level directory for Totara must not be web accessible.
   
4. Install Totara.  
   This can be done in a number of ways. If this is your first time doing this then we recommend installing through
   the web interface. Once your web server has been configured simply open your web browser, and enter your sites URL.
   You will be taken to the installation process. There are two things that will happen. The first is that you will be 
   prompted to enter required information including the database details, and directory for files. Once that information 
   has been gathered a config.php will be generated and put into the top level Totara directory. If the web server does
   not have write access to that directory (and it shouldn't) then you will be prompted to create this yourself by
   copying the details from the browser to the file.  
   Once the config.php file exists the installation will continue to create the database structure and essential data,
   and prepare the site data directory.

   As a partner, you will now need to set the flavour that the site is using to ensure that the correct
   functionality is available to the site.
   This can be done by defining the following in your config.php:
   ```php
   $CFG->forceflavour = 'learn';
   ```
   
   The following are valid flavours:
   * learn_perform_engage
   * learn_perform
   * learn_engage
   * perform_engage
   * learn
   * perform
   * engage
   
5. Configure cron.  
   Totara offloads heavy processing to cron. The likes of email, bulk enrolments, data imports all occur on cron. It is
   essential to have cron configured and running on your site. How you do this depends upon your environment, however
   you must configure cron to call **server/admin/cli/cron.php** on a regular basis. We have designed it to be called
   once a minute, however you are free to choose a schedule that works for you. Greater time between runs will lead to
   users having to wait for actions to be processed.

    Reports -> Live Logs

2.  Enable maintenance mode in Totara.
    Server -> Maintenance Mode

3.  Backup the Totara database.

4.  Backup the site data directory.

5.  Backup the Totara source code directory.

6.  Remove the old source code, and extract the new source code into the source code directory.
    Note: Do not copy the new code on top of the existing code folder.
    If optional libraries were installed before then use composer to reinstall updated dependencies
    in /libraries/ directory.

7.  Navigate to the admin/index.php page. The upgrade process will
    automatically start.

8.  Check for Warnings or Errors on the upgrade review page.

9.  Edit new settings page if required.
